# Footer

The **Footer** component appears at the bottom of every page and provides consistent access to important links, branding, and contact information.  
It is divided into structured sections that can include the logo, customer links, support links, and legal information.  
All content and links are managed via **Craft CMS** and configured in the **Global Variables** under the **mm_footer** settings.
