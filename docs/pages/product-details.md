# Product Details Page

The **Product Detail Page (PDP)** is the central entry point for customers to learn more about a specific product.  
It provides comprehensive information, visual representation, and purchase options to support the customerâ€™s decision-making process.

## Product Detail Page â€“ Data Sources

The fields and configurations used on the **Product Detail Page (PDP)** are primarily managed through two systems:

- **Craft CMS**:  
  Most product-related content is maintained under the **Entries** menu, inside the **Shop Products** channel.  
  Each entry in this channel represents a product and contains fields organized across multiple tabs such as _Metadata_, _Product Listing_, _Callout_, _Additional Information_, and others.

- **BigCommerce**:  
  Product data such as pricing, variations, modifiers, and images are retrieved directly from BigCommerce.  
  These items complement or override Craft CMS content when required to ensure accurate product information and synchronization with the e-commerce catalog.

Detailed mappings between fields and their respective sources are described in the following sections.
