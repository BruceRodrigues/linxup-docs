# Cart Page

The **Cart Page** displays the products that a customer has added to their shopping cart, along with pricing, quantity selection, and options for related products.  
It allows users to review their selected items, adjust quantities, remove products, and proceed to checkout.

The page also includes **related product suggestions**, call-to-action buttons, and informational banners, all managed through **Craft CMS** and product data retrieved from **BigCommerce**.

## Cart Page â€“ Data Sources

The fields and configurations used on the **Cart Page** are managed through two main sources:

- **Craft CMS**:  
  All page content is defined under the **Entries** menu, specifically within the entry named **Cart**.  
  This entry contains structured fields that define banners, callouts, and instructional text.  
  These fields control the static layout, content, and messaging displayed on the page.

- **BigCommerce**:  
  Product-specific data such as product name, price, quantity, image, and availability is retrieved dynamically from BigCommerce.  
  Related products and product suggestions displayed on the Cart Page also pull data directly from BigCommerce to ensure consistency with the live catalog.

Detailed mappings between fields and their respective sources are described in the following sections.
