## Ordering Page â€“ Data Sources

The fields and configurations used on the **Ordering Page** are managed through two main sources:

- **Craft CMS**:  
  All page content is defined under the **Entries** menu, specifically within the entry named **Customer Add-On Page**.  
  This entry contains structured fields across multiple tabs that define banners, product groupings by category, callouts, and instructional content.  
  These fields control the static layout and textual information displayed on the page.

- **BigCommerce**:  
  Product-related information, such as product names, images, prices, and categories, is retrieved directly from BigCommerce.  
  The page displays products grouped by category using this data to ensure consistency with the active e-commerce catalog.
